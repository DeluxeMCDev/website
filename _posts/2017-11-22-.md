Recently we've moved the server to Uberspace to test what their hosting is like. Other than this host change, not a lot has happened in recent months due to us being busy. Notable changes since the last post in April are:  
- New separate hub world  
- A lot of plugin tweaks and fixes (memory leak fix in Extras plugin)  
- Updates to support Minecraft 1.12.2  
- ICU plugin testing
