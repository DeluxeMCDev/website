Vanilla Minecraft commands will now be preferred over plugin commands. This means that:  
- Any Essentials commands that were previously accessible without a prefix (e.g. /give) now require a prefix (e.g. /essentials:give or /egive)  
- Kaboom's /tag command should be accessed with /prefix, /rank or /extras:tag  
- Kaboom's custom /tellraw command should be accessed with /broadcastraw, /bcraw or /extras:tellraw
